# GeneticAlgorithm

Basic genetic algorithm written in C that simulates natural selection with an initial set of ten integers. The program selectively produces offspring for numbers closest to the "desired genome", ultimately producing the genome itself after several generations.

In essence, this program breeds 16-bit integers.
